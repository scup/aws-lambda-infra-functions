# AWS Lambda Infra functions

This project has some common lambdas that can help you to automate some tasks in your system.

# How to build the lambdas

You can build the lambdas ready to upload to AWS using the following command:

```bash
yarn build
```

The zip file will be created on **packages** folder

# How to test the lambda locally

```bash
yarn debug -- --function lambda_name
```

## Configuring and using Lambdas

To use a lambda published in this library, you need to upload the zip file built by this library, set the a handler point to the specific lambda and set a group of environment variables used in the lambda configuration.

- GRAPHQL_VAR: the name of the variable that will receive the entire content from the HTTP body. Example: 'data'

### kinesisToGraphql

**handler**: lambda.kinesisToGraphql
